# Status

Last updated 2026-10-25 (UTC). Network mode so far: **local sandbox and NEAR testnet** (since 2026-10-25). Nothing is on mainnet, and no real funds have moved: testnet NEAR and the TUSD test token have no value.

## Milestone: AGENTS.md section 19 steps 1-5

| Step | State |
|---|---|
| 1. Verify rules and SDKs, write INTEGRATIONS.md | done; `HACKATHON.md` added from the owner's copy (live version not fetched) |
| 2. ARCHITECTURE, THREAT_MODEL, DECISIONS, STATUS | done |
| 3. Monorepo with lint/typecheck/test/build baseline | done (pnpm + cargo workspaces, CI workflow) |
| 4. Vault with owner/agent auth and policy validation, negative tests | done |
| 5. Mock NEP-141 + sandbox direct payment; reservation, failure, replay, concurrency, rollover | done (rollover in unit tests only) |
| 6. Dashboard, Telegram, wallet approval page, then P1 | dashboard, approval page and Telegram notifier built and tested on sandbox (Telegram against a mock Bot API); approval with a real wallet done on testnet; P1 not started |

## P0 checklist (AGENTS.md section 4)

| # | Item | State |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | single owner + agent + one NEP-141 token | local tested (sandbox); deployed on testnet (see below) |
| 2 | policy with auto, daily and per-tx limits, allowlists, pause | local tested |
| 3 | agent requests via API/MCP; contract rejects unsafe requests | MCP server: local tested (sandbox, over stdio) and **run on testnet from Claude Code** (paid, held for approval, blocked; see below); **API not built** |
| 4 | auto payment executes with on-chain receipt | local tested (sandbox); on testnet the deploy script's `demo-auto-1` (3 TUSD) was paid by the agent's restricted key |
| 5 | larger payment awaits approval; Telegram notice | local tested: the notifier alerts on sandbox, then follows up when paid; **real Telegram delivery untested** (mock Bot API; api.telegram.org unreachable here) |
| 6 | owner wallet approves the exact request; executes once | local tested in a real browser (sandbox, dev signer); **testnet: the owner approved and paid `demo-approve-1` (25 TUSD) with Meteor Wallet on the hosted site**, and the page showed "Confirmed on chain" (owner's report, 2026-10-25). Other wallets untested |
| 7 | dashboard | local tested in a real browser (sandbox): balance, budget, open requests and activity match the chain; inconsistent budget data from the RPC is flagged; no tx hashes (no indexer) |
| 8 | Security Lab, at least 6 negative tests | local tested: generated report and page; 13 of 18 cases pass on a local chain, 3 in unit tests only, 2 are P1 (THREAT_MODEL.md); CI builds the report and publishes it with the site to GitHub Pages from main (ADR-023) |
| 9 | public app, README, video, submission | public repo; site live at https://0xileri.github.io/Spact/ for the testnet vault, with a landing page and brand (ADR-024); README in progress; video and submission not started |

## Testnet deployment (2026-10-25)

Deployed by the owner with `scripts/deploy-testnet.sh spact-ileri2.testnet 0xileri.testnet` from WSL Ubuntu (near-cli-rs 0.30.1, rustc 1.97.0). Testnet reported protocol version 88. The hosted site reads this vault (repository variable `VITE_VAULT_ID`).

| | Account | Explorer |
|---|---|---|
| Vault | `vault.spact-ileri2.testnet` | https://testnet.nearblocks.io/address/vault.spact-ileri2.testnet |
| Owner (Meteor Wallet) | `0xileri.testnet` | https://testnet.nearblocks.io/address/0xileri.testnet |
| Agent | `agent.spact-ileri2.testnet` | https://testnet.nearblocks.io/address/agent.spact-ileri2.testnet |
| Test token (TUSD, 6 decimals, no value) | `tusd.spact-ileri2.testnet` | https://testnet.nearblocks.io/address/tusd.spact-ileri2.testnet |
| Payee | `api.spact-ileri2.testnet` | https://testnet.nearblocks.io/address/api.spact-ileri2.testnet |

- **Vault code hash** (`view-account-summary`): `bb664f2a1b19734e5bbb8f01372d737fcc724ae008be284603c7dd4dc191c81c`, the same as the `spact_vault.wasm` the script built on the owner's machine from main at `824dac0`.
- **`get_config` after the deploy:** owner `0xileri.testnet`, agents `[agent.spact-ileri2.testnet]`, network `testnet`, `request_count` 2, `open_approvals` 1, not paused.
- **Agent keys** (`list-keys`): one full-access key, which stays with the operator, and one function-call key that can only call `request_direct_payment` and `execute_request` on the vault. That key's allowance went from 0.25 to 0.2490 NEAR for the two requests.
- **Vault keys:** one full-access key, in the operator's `~/.near-credentials`. Whoever holds it can redeploy the vault (THREAT_MODEL).
- **Approval:** `demo-approve-1` was approved and paid from https://0xileri.github.io/Spact/?request=demo-approve-1 with Meteor Wallet. The transaction hash is not recorded here yet; the vault's explorer page lists it.
- **Not checked from the build environment:** testnet is unreachable from here, so the facts above come from the owner's terminal output and wallet.
- **First attempt:** an earlier run with deployer `spact-ileri.testnet` used a placeholder owner name (`ileri-owner.testnet`) instead of the owner's wallet account. That vault cannot be approved by the owner and is abandoned; it holds only test tokens. The script now refuses an owner account that does not exist, and a deployer that was used before, before it builds or spends anything.
- **Agent on testnet (2026-10-25):** Claude Code 2.1.310 in WSL Ubuntu, with the MCP server registered by `claude mcp add` (local scope) using the restricted key file and `SPACT_APPROVAL_URL=https://0xileri.github.io/Spact/`. Results as reported by Claude Code and the owner:

  | Request | Amount | Result |
  |---|---|---|
  | `agent-auto-1` | 5 TUSD | `AUTO_APPROVED`, `SETTLED`: [`FCHU8BxD…`](https://testnet.nearblocks.io/txns/FCHU8BxDHkerijBpSKo8j7BVEZLdnppbixvYbDhU1Y1N). The tool was not loaded in that session (see below), so Claude started the built server from a script and called `request_payment` through it; the server's startup checks passed first |
  | `agent-approve-1` | 12 TUSD | through the MCP tool: `OWNER_APPROVAL_REQUIRED` with the review link, request transaction [`7VpgQUxR…`](https://testnet.nearblocks.io/txns/7VpgQUxRwkBt7na3w4w5EMkxGnjUZQYNF5na1koSrQKc); then `SETTLED` after the owner approved it as `0xileri.testnet` on the site |
  | `agent-blocked-1` | 5 TUSD to `evil.testnet` | `BLOCKED`, `RECIPIENT_NOT_ALLOWED`; nothing stored or sent |
  | `agent-pay-1` | 1 TUSD | `SETTLED` under the auto limit |

- **What the agent run showed:**
  - *Lost registration.* The first `claude mcp add` ran before Claude Code's first-run setup, and was gone after it (`claude mcp get spact` found nothing). Adding it again after the setup stuck. apps/mcp/README.md now says to finish the setup first.
  - *The vault is the boundary, not the tool.* Without the tool, Claude in auto mode reached the vault anyway by running the server from Bash. It could only do what the restricted key and the vault allow, which is the design (THREAT_MODEL).
  - *A confusing "Confirmed".* After the first approval attempt the owner saw "Confirmed on chain" while the vault still showed the request waiting. Reopening the link fresh, the approval went through. The page only prints that banner after reading the request as settled, so the likeliest cause is an older tab from `demo-approve-1`. This was not reproduced.
- **Build reproducibility:** the same source built in this environment gives `70803e02…` instead of `bb664f2a…`. The wasm embeds build-machine paths (e.g. `/root/.cargo/registry/...`). Remapping that one path did not reproduce the deployed hash, so another difference remains. Anyone checking the deployed code against the source cannot do it bit for bit yet.

## Tests (last run 2026-10-24; deploy rehearsal 2026-10-25)

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `scripts/test-contracts.sh` | vault unit 51 passed; mock-ft unit 1 passed; sandbox 10 passed |
| `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` (in `contracts/`) | clean |
| `cargo fmt --all --check` | clean |
| `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm build` | clean; shared 19 passed, web 33 passed, mcp 24 passed, notifier 27 passed, security-lab 8 passed |
| `scripts/security-report.sh` (every suite, then the report) | 180 tests in 10 suites passed; report: 13 cases passed on a local chain, 3 unit only (T07, T10, T15), 2 not covered (T13, T14, P1) |
| `pnpm notifier:sandbox` (built notifier, local sandbox, mock Bot API) | 4 passed: links only the private chat with the terminal's code (group, wrong code and forged button ignored); alert with exact terms and the approval page as the only link; follow-up after the owner approves and pays; after a restart no repeats, and a new request is alerted with the link in its note defanged |
| `pnpm mcp:sandbox` (built MCP server over stdio, local sandbox) | 11 passed: two tools only; auto payment settles; larger request waits, then is paid after the owner approves; hard cap blocked; T18 prompt-injected request to an unlisted account blocked; duplicate id not paid twice; bad input sends nothing; startup refused with a full-access key, a key for another contract, or a missing key |
| `pnpm e2e` (Chromium, local sandbox; the agent signs with its function-call key) | 19 passed: the landing page states the vault's limits as read from its policy, its hero animation uses amounts from those limits, its live numbers match the chain, and it fits a 390 px screen; the hero animation plays paid, waiting and blocked in turn, each rule card loops on its own clock, both pause off screen, sections fade in as they are reached, and with reduced motion every animation is one still frame and everything shows at once; the published site has a working skip link, a Privacy and terms page and a branded 404; the production build under `/Spact/` with no vault serves the landing page and the Security Lab, says no vault is connected elsewhere, carries share-card tags with absolute URLs, serves its image, and makes no request outside its own host; inside a frame neither site draws anything to click; the Security Lab page shows cases, evidence and the CI run link; a report that contradicts its own evidence is not believed; a missing or broken report is named as such; dashboard matches the chain (balance, budget, waiting request, activity rows); a tampered budget is flagged instead of shown; approve and pay, reject, altered recipient flagged, forged hash refused by the vault, non-owner blocked, foreign-vault link refused, open-request list |

Manual check on a testnet build: the near-connect wallet selector opens with no page errors and lists Meteor, Intear, Ledger, Nightly, Ethereum wallets and NEAR CLI (2026-10-24).

GitHub Actions `ci` run 1 (commit `8b91f83`) passed both jobs. The contracts job ran all 8 sandbox tests on the hosted runner without the rlimit shim.

Measured: an auto payment (request + ft_transfer + callback) burnt about 7 Tgas in sandbox.

Redesign skill pass (2026-10-25/26), DECISIONS ADR-026:
- **What changed:** one typeface (Space Grotesk) plus Geist Mono, Phosphor icons, a spacing scale, one motion curve and a grain overlay, all in the ADR-024 colors. A floating pill nav, loading skeletons, a skip link, a Privacy and terms page and a branded 404.
- **Second pass:** the owner found the first pass too busy. The landing page is now three sections (hero, the three rules, the live vault), and the hero is an animated graphic of the vault's gate. In it, one request is paid, one waits for the wallet and is approved, and one is blocked. Its amounts are picked from the vault's own limits. Each rule card plays a short loop of its own outcome.
- **Motion:** the graphic and the cards loop while on screen and pause off screen; rules and live numbers fade up as they are reached. With reduced motion every loop is one still frame and everything shows at once. All of it is e2e-tested.
- **Checked:** `scripts/check-web-image.sh` now has 16 checks (the 404 page is the branded one) and passed all 16 against a local Caddy. Screenshots at 1280 and 390 px; the phone view has no horizontal scroll.

Railway and redesign (2026-10-25):
- **Owner check:** Railway serves the site at `spact.up.railway.app` with the testnet vault, and `scripts/check-web-image.sh` passed all 15 checks from the owner's machine.
- **Image:** a root `Dockerfile` serves the site with Caddy 2.11.7 and real security headers (DECISIONS ADR-025).
- **Local check:** Caddy's own release binary (checksum verified) served a production build here. `scripts/check-web-image.sh` passed all 15 checks: headers on the page and assets, a one-year cache for hashed assets, share tags, a 404 for unknown paths, and path traversal refused. Against a plain server without the headers it reports 9 failures.
- **Docker:** no daemon runs here, so the image itself is first built and run by CI's `web-image` job.
- **Not checked from here:** whether GitHub Pages lets other sites read the report (CORS), which the Railway site needs; `github.io` is unreachable from here.
- **Redesign:** the landing page got a hero with an example flow, the outcomes band, how it works, a wallet-versus-Spact comparison, the live vault, a Security Lab section, a get-started terminal and a footer. The skill pass above replaced its header, type and dark section.

Landing page and brand (2026-10-25): `/` is now a landing page (DECISIONS ADR-024). It says what Spact is, states the three outcomes in the configured vault's own limits read from its policy, shows live numbers from chain and the Security Lab counts from the CI report. The dashboard moved to `?page=overview`; approval links are unchanged. Brand: ink on paper, the outcomes as signal colors (paid, waits, blocked), a gate logo, Space Grotesk bundled with the site, favicons and a share card rendered by `apps/web/dev/render-brand.ts`. Checked by screenshot at 1280 and 390 px.

Deploy script checks (2026-10-25): before building or spending anything, `scripts/deploy-testnet.sh` now stops if the owner account does not exist or the deployer was used before. It also passes `--signature-scheme ed25519`, because near-cli-rs 0.30.1 asks in a terminal and the agent's MCP server reads only ed25519 keys. `scripts/rehearse-deploy-sandbox.sh` passed 12 checks: a missing owner refused before building, the full deploy, a second run with the same deployer refused before building, the refused NEAR transfer, and the eight chain checks. With a fake RPC that answers an error, the account check stops the script instead of reading the error as "no account".

Testnet deploy rehearsal (2026-10-24): `scripts/rehearse-deploy-sandbox.sh` ran `scripts/deploy-testnet.sh` unchanged with near-cli-rs 0.30.1 against a fresh sandbox node (protocol version 86). All six checks passed: vault owner and network set, the 3 TUSD request SETTLED, the 25 TUSD request AWAITING_APPROVAL, payee balance 3 TUSD, vault balance 997 TUSD. Commands come from the NEAR docs (`near/docs` @ `04d956c`, see INTEGRATIONS.md). Not covered: the faucet, the testnet network itself, and wallet signing.

GitHub Pages (2026-10-24): the `pages` job in `ci.yml` publishes the site from main after every job passed, with that run's Security Lab report (ADR-023). With no vault configured, the site is the Security Lab alone. The browser suite builds the site the same way and serves it under `/Spact/`. With the frame guard or `base: "./"` removed, the new tests fail. `actionlint` 1.7.12 passes the workflow. Live since 2026-10-24 at https://0xileri.github.io/Spact/; the first deploy failed until Pages was turned on (source: GitHub Actions), as expected. Since 2026-10-25 it is built with `VITE_VAULT_ID=vault.spact-ileri2.testnet`.

Security Lab (2026-10-24): the approval site has a Security Lab page (`?page=security`) built from a report that is generated from real test runs (DECISIONS ADR-022). The full local run matched every catalog entry to a test that ran and passed. CI builds the same report from its jobs' artifacts.

Dashboard (2026-10-24): `/` now shows the vault's balance and today's budget per token, the open requests, agent activity and who can do what, all read from chain (DECISIONS ADR-021). Checked at 1280 px and 390 px wide with no horizontal scroll; on phones the activity table becomes cards.

Telegram notifier (2026-10-24): `apps/notifier` alerts the owner when a payment waits and follows up when it settles (DECISIONS ADR-020). It is tested against a mock Bot API, because Telegram is unreachable from here. The sandbox test caught a real bug: the first version assumed `list_requests` is oldest first (it is newest first) and missed requests that came after its first pass.

Rename (2026-10-24): the project is now Spact (DECISIONS ADR-019), including the hash domain and event standard. After the rename all suites passed again: contracts (51 unit, 1 mock-ft, 10 sandbox), TypeScript (shared 19, web 14, mcp 24), `pnpm e2e` 7, `pnpm mcp:sandbox` 11, and the deploy rehearsal's 10 checks.

MCP server (2026-10-24; testnet 2026-10-25, see "Testnet deployment"): `apps/mcp` gives the agent `request_payment` and `get_payment_status` over stdio, signed with its function-call key (DECISIONS ADR-018). With an isolated config, `claude mcp add` plus `claude mcp list` (Claude Code 2.1.310) showed the sandbox server as `Connected`. Codex was not available here to try.

Agent key (2026-10-24): the agent now signs with a function-call key that reaches only the vault's `request_direct_payment` and `execute_request` (DECISIONS ADR-017). Sandbox tests `t19_*` and `t20_*` show that it works for requests and execution, and that the protocol rejects everything else: other contracts, other vault methods, deposits, NEAR transfers, adding keys, deleting the account, and use after the allowance runs out. The rehearsal now runs the deploy script's own key step and passes ten checks: the key's receiver, methods and allowance, a refused NEAR transfer, and the six earlier ones. Two agent requests used 0.00092 NEAR of the 0.25 NEAR allowance.

## Unresolved risks

- Eligibility of code written before 2026-11-01 (DECISIONS ADR-000).
- The vault account's full-access key can redeploy the code (THREAT_MODEL).
- On testnet the agent account's full-access key stays with the operator (ADR-017); the mainnet choice is open.
- No reconciliation path for a stuck TRANSFER_PENDING; no storage pruning.
- Mainnet protocol support for the rustc 1.97 wasm output is unverified (testnet runs it: protocol 88).
- Only Meteor Wallet has signed an approval; other wallets are untested.
- The vault wasm is not reproducible across build machines, so the deployed code hash cannot yet be checked bit for bit against the source.
- No Content-Security-Policy, and framing is refused by script rather than a `frame-ancestors` header, which GitHub Pages cannot send (ADR-023).

## Next smallest task

Record the `demo-approve-1` approval transaction hash here (testnet).

Record the approval transaction hashes for `demo-approve-1` and `agent-approve-1` here, if the owner has them.

Then, on the owner's machine: with a bot from @BotFather, run the notifier (apps/notifier/README.md) against the testnet vault and check that the alert arrives on the phone.
